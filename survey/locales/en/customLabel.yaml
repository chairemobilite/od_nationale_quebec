    <p class="_orange">The questionnaire asks me to describe my trips for a
    particular day, but that day is not a typical example of my
    commute.</p><p>The goal of the survey is to measure and reflect the travel
    practices of the entire region during an average weekday. It is normal and
    statistically acceptable to have a set of respondents with a higher number
    of trips through their day and another set with a lower number of trips than
    their personal average. Same with respect to modes of transport used, where
    a person who normally takes transit may have driven or vice versa. It is
    important to describe what you actually did on the requested day.</p><p>For
    more details, you can refer to the <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers"
    target="_blank">following article on the law of large numbers</a>.</p><p>In
    summary, with a large number of responses for days randomly assigned, the
    aggregate of all responses should accurately reflect an average day of
    travel for the population surveyed.</p>
